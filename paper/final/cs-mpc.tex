We use an MPC controller with a quadratic and a linear cost for comparison.
The finite RHC approach involves optimizing a cost function subject to the dynamics of the system and the constraints, over a finite horizon of time \cite{Mayne2000}. After an optimal sequence of control inputs is computed, the first input is applied, then at the next step the optimization is solved again.

The objective of the controller is to minimize the energy usage $c^Tu$ while maintaining a desired level of thermal comfort $x_{ref}$ (or $\tT_\mathrm{ref}$).
Therefore, at time step $k$, we solve a continuously linearized MPC problem to determine the optimal sequence of inputs $[u_{\mathrm{k|k}},\dots,u_{\mathrm{k+N-1|k}}]$:

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		& \underset{u_{k+j},\epsilon_j}{\text{minimize}} & & \sum_{j=1}^{N} ({x}_{k+j} - x_{ref})\top Q ({x}_{k+j} - x_{ref}) + c^Tu_{k+j-1} +  \lambda\epsilon_j \\
		& \text{subject to }                             & & x_{k+j} = Ax_{k+j-1} + B u_{k+j-1} + B_d d_{k+j-1} \label{SE:mpc1}                                   \\
		&                                                & & B       = B_u + B_{xu}[x_{k}] + B_{du}[d_{k+j-1}] \label{SE:mpc2}                                    \\
		&                                                & & \underline{u} \leq u_{k+j-1} \leq \bar{u} 									   	                      \\
		&                                                & & \underline{x} - \epsilon_j \leq x_{k+j} \leq \bar{x} + \epsilon_j                                    \\
		&                                                & & \epsilon_j \geq 0, \ j = 1,\dots,N,            									                 
	\end{align}\label{E:mpc}

\noindent where $Q \in \R^{12 \times 12}$ has all zeros except at $Q^{(1,1)}$ corresponding to the zone temperature, $c \in \R^{4}$ is proportional to cost of using each actuator and $\lambda$ penalizes the slack variables.
